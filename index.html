            <p>Bobby went on to pursue a Restaurant Management and Culinary Arts degree from Laney College. 
                He would’ve been welcomed into the culinary profession, but instead, he found work and 
                purpose as a registered behavioral technician. Years later, reflecting on the power of the 
                support he received in launching his career, Bobby returned to Sprouts Chef Training to serve
                and empower youth like him. This inspiring story is one of incredible resilience and 
                determination. Pictured at left is Bobby Pennington, with his chef training mentor on
